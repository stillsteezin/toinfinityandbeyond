        <p> On April 12th, 1961 the Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to enter space.
          Since then both government agencies and entrepreneurs are have been drawing up more concrete plans to return to the Moon, and even travel onward to Mars.
          Getting there is one thing, but if we plan to set up colonies, we'll have to figure out how to feed ourselves.
          Will Earth crops grow in space—and, if so, will they be able to feed our growing communities? <br> <br> Space is harsh. 
          In space, the conditions required for plants to grow (such as water, light, nutrients and suitable temperature) are difficult to meet.
          Scientists have dedicated enormous amounts of research on the topic, and in 2015 the crew members of the ISS Expedition 44 were able to
          have their first taste of space-grown food. Since then, scientists have been researching novel ways of growing other plants in space. <br><br>
          Plants are useful in space not only as a food source: astronauts are also hoping to use plants to create a self-sustaining circuit to supply
          astronauts with all the oxygen, water and food they need – without any resupply from Earth. As our civilization turns into a multi-planetary community,
          our ability to grow plants will become integral to our survival. <br><br><br> To read more about NASA’s Veggie mission check out their website:
